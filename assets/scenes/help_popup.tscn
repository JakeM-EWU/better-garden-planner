1. Introduction
Welcome to the Better Garden Planner App, your comprehensive 
companion for garden planning and management. 

This application offers a user-friendly interface and a host of 
features to help you design your dream garden. 

This manual will guide you through the application's usage, 
explaining each feature in detail. 
The Better Garden Planner App is a free alternative to apps such as 
the Farmer's Almanac Vegetable Garden Planner, designed to make 
garden planning a breeze.

2. Getting Started
Upon launching the Better Garden Planner App, you will encounter a 
beautifully designed title screen with two options: \"New Project\" 
and \"Load Project\".

 \"New Project\" allows you to create a new garden plan from scratch.
 \"Load Project\" allows you to load a previously saved garden plan.


3. Creating a New Project
To create a new project, click on the \"New Project\" button.
A dialog box will appear, prompting you to enter the dimensions (X, Y) 
of your garden. You can adjust these dimensions in three ways:

Moving the slider
Using the \"up\" and \"down\" arrows
Directly entering the number in the box

The dimensions cannot exceed 100 or be less than 1. 
We recommend starting with a manageable size that will fill the 
screen, such as 15 by 10. Once you have set your desired dimensions, 
click the \"Create\" button to proceed.

4. Main Interface
The main interface of the Better Garden Planner App is where you 
will design your garden. The interface is divided into two main
sections:

Workspace: This is the area where you will design your garden. 
You can zoom in and out to view different parts of your garden.

Menu Bar: Located at the top of the screen, 
the menu bar provides access to various features of the application. 
It includes the following options: \"File\", \"Edit\", \"View\", and \"Help\".


5. File Menu
The \"File\" menu provides several options for managing your 
garden plan:

Create Garden: This option allows you to start a new garden plan.
Save as: This option allows you to save your current garden plan. 
You can choose a specific name for your plan.
Load: This option allows you to load a previously saved garden plan.
Exit: This option allows you to close the application.
Export Image: This option allows you to save a PNG image of your 
current garden design.

6. Edit Menu
The \"Edit\" menu provides several options for managing the objects 
in your garden:

Place Object: This option opens a menu with a list of available plants. 
You can search for a specific plant using the search bar. 
To place a plant, select it from the list and click on your desired location 
in the workspace.

Delete Object: This option allows you to delete objects from your garden. 
When selected, the application enters \"delete mode\". 
In this mode, you can click on an object to delete it.

Move Object: This option allows you to move objects within your garden. 
When selected, the application enters \"move mode\". In this mode, 
you can click on an object to select it and then click a spot on the grid 
to move it to a new location.

7. View Menu
The \"View\" menu provides several options for viewing information
 about your garden:

Inventory: This option displays a list of all the plants in your garden, 
along with their quantities.

Schedule: This option displays a planting schedule for each unique 
plant in your garden. The schedule includes a start date and end 
date for planting, as well as notes about starting indoors or 
outdoors and transplanting.

Notes: This option opens a notebook where you can record additional 
information about your garden. You can add, save, and delete notes as needed.

8. Help Menu
The \"Help\" menu provides additional information and assistance for using the 
Better Garden Planner App:

User Guide: This option opens the \"Instructions and FAQ\" page, which provides 
detailed instructions on how to use the application and answers to 
frequently asked questions.


9. Designing Your Garden
To design your garden, first, select the \"Place Object\" option from the \"Edit\" 
menu. This will open a menu with a list of available plants. 
You can search for a specific plant using the search bar. 
To place a plant, select it from the list and click on your desired location in the 
workspace. Hold down the right mouse button to drag the camera around the 
screen, and use the scroll wheel to zoom in and out as needed. 

The size of the plants in the workspace is not representative of their real-life 
size but serves as a visual marker for where to plant. You should space your 
plants based on the information provided on the seed packets or other research. 
It is recommended that you keep specific notes on varieties, planting information, 
and weather events in the notebook feature (see section 10).

If you wish to delete or move a plant, select the \"Delete Object\" or 
\"Move Object\" option from the \"Edit\" menu, respectively. This will put the 
application in \"delete mode\" or \"move mode\". In these modes, you can 
click on a plant to delete it or click and drag a plant to move it. 
Press the \"Esc\" key to exit either mode.


10. Managing Your Garden
The Better Garden Planner App provides several tools for managing your garden:

Inventory: The inventory provides a count of each type of plant in your garden. 
This can help you keep track of what you have planted and plan for what 
you need to plant.

Schedule: The schedule provides a timeline for when to plant each type 
of plant in your garden. This can help you plan your planting activities 
and ensure that each plant is planted at the optimal time.

Notes: The notes feature allows you to record additional information 
about your garden. This can be useful for recording details about specific 
plant varieties, frost dates, and other important information.

11. Saving and Exporting Your Garden
Once you are satisfied with your garden design, you can save it for 
future use by selecting the \"Save as\" option from the \"File\" menu. 
You can also export an image of your garden design by selecting the 
\"Export Image\" option from the \"File\" menu.

12. Conclusion
The Better Garden Planner App is a comprehensive tool for planning 
and managing your garden. With its user-friendly interface and wide 
array of features, it makes garden planning a breeze. We hope this user 
manual has provided you with a clear understanding of how to use the 
application. If you have any further questions, please refer to the \"Help\" 
menu or contact our support team. 

Happy gardening!"
